    <h1>Land Ice Loss in Antarctica</h1>
    <p>The video below shows the recent sudden loss of land ice in Antarctica, measured by satellites.  The map shows, at each point in time, whether ice sheet elevation is increasing or decreasing.  Areas on the map are coloured in red where ice is being lost, and in blue where ice is being gained.  Green indicates little or no change.</p>
    <p>The line chart shows whether, on average over the continent of Antarctica, ice sheet elevation is increasing or decreasing, over time.</p>
